Smart-Pacman
===============
### Intro
A Python based AI capable of playing various versions of the classic game of Pacman . The AI uses **Q-Learning and value iteration** to obtain the heuristical best policy for a given **Markov Decision Process** . The AI is first tested on an easier layout of **Gridworld (from class)** and then applied on simulated bot controller **(Crawler)** and **Pacman** . It was done in the summers of 2016 to understand reinforcement learning.
### Layouts and Examples
The software consists of 4 layouts :
* SmallGrid (simple layout with 2 pac-dots and 1 enemy)
* SmallClassic (complex layout with many pac-dots and 2 enemies)
* MediumGrid  (large simple layout with 3 pac-dots and 1 enemies)
* MediumClassic (large complex layout with many pac-dots and 2 enemies)
An example for MediumClassic AI is :
